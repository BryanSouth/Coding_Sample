This project was for a machine learning course. I chose the earthquake prediction challenge. The dataset was a time series of acoustic data (seismometer readings) and the actual time left until the next earthquake. I chose to use an LSTM RNN architecture given the time dependent nature of the problem. The LSTM can take into account information from previous time steps to perform the regression. 
This code I'd say is in an "intermediate" development state. I have left it in this state to show I code to allow myself to debug errors more easily.
